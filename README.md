# PlantGuard: A Plant Leaf Disease Recognition System using Convolutional Neural Network

## Overview

A plant leaf disease recognition system that harnesses the power of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) algorithm to detect plant conditions. The model used in this project was trained using [Plant Disease Recognition Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rashikrahmanpritom/plant-disease-recognition-dataset/).
